A simplistic photoblog made with jQuery. 

I'm in the process of creating a personal blogging site that is simplistic and streamlined. 

The goals for the site are as follows:

1) Minimalistic style.

2) Fully responsive and functional across all devices and screen widths.

3) One page site, navigating content with jquery. 

4) Highly optimized content loading, so images load almost instantly. 

This is a work in progress.
